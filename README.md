This repository contains a machine learning project for diabetes prediction using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. 
The SVM algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression tasks. 
In this project, we will be using the SVM algorithm for binary classification of diabetes.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset which contains various features of female patients of Pima Indian heritage, including their age, BMI, insulin level, blood pressure, and others. The target variable is whether or not the patient has diabetes (1 for positive, 0 for negative).
